## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
- **Interactive Map**: Leaflet-based map with polygon drawing capabilities
- **Time Navigation**: Dual-mode slider (single time / time range) with 30-day window
- **Dynamic Polygon Coloring**: Real-time color updates based on weather data
- **Weather Data Integration**: Open-Meteo API integration for historical weather data
- **State Management**: Zustand store with localStorage persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### ✅ UI Components
- **TimeSlider**: Horizontal timeline with dual handle support
- **Map**: Interactive Leaflet map with polygon drawing
- **Sidebar**: Polygon management and configuration panel
- **DataSourceModal**: Configuration modal for new polygons
- **Color Rule Editor**: Visual color threshold configuration

### ✅ Data Sources
- Temperature (2m above ground)
- Relative Humidity (2m)
- Precipitation
- Wind Speed (10m above ground)

### ✅ Technical Features
- TypeScript for type safety
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Axios for API requests
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- RC-Slider for time navigation

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Drawing Polygons
1. Click "Draw New Polygon" in the sidebar
2. Click on the map to add vertices (3-12 vertices allowed)
3. Double-click to finish drawing
4. Configure polygon name and data source in the modal

### 2. Time Navigation
- **Single Time Mode**: Select a specific hour to view data
- **Time Range Mode**: Select a time period for analysis
- Use the slider to navigate through the 30-day window (-15 to +15 days)

### 3. Configuring Color Rules
1. Click the settings icon on any polygon
2. Add/edit color rules with different operators (<, <=, >, >=, =, !=)
3. Set thresholds and colors for different value ranges
4. Rules are applied in order - first matching rule determines color

### 4. Managing Polygons
- Rename polygons by clicking the edit icon
- Delete polygons using the trash icon
- Change data sources from the dropdown
- View polygon count in the sidebar

## 🌐 API Integration

The application uses the **Open-Meteo Historical Weather API**:
- **No API key required** - completely free
- **Historical data** available for past years
- **Hourly resolution** for precise visualization
- **Multiple parameters** supported

Example API endpoint:
```
https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&start_date=2025-07-18&end_date=2025-08-01&hourly=temperature_2m
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

- Polygons and settings are automatically saved to localStorage
- State persists across browser sessions
- Weather data is cached to minimize API requests
- Time selections are remembered

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
No environment variables required - the Open-Meteo API is free and doesn't require authentication.

### Customization Options
- Add new data sources in `src/types/index.ts`
- Modify default color rules in `src/lib/utils.ts`
- Customize styling in `src/app/globals.css`
- Adjust time range in `src/components/TimeSlider.tsx`

## 📦 Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Other Platforms
- Netlify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Amplify

## 🧪 Testing

The application includes:
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint for code quality
- Responsive design testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

## 📱 Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not loading**: Check internet connection and browser console
2. **Polygons not saving**: Ensure localStorage is enabled
3. **API errors**: Check network connectivity and API status
4. **Performance issues**: Clear browser cache and restart

### Debug Mode
Open browser developer tools to see:
- API request logs
- State management updates
- Error messages
- Performance metrics

## 📈 Performance

- **Initial load**: ~3-4 seconds
- **API response**: ~500ms-2s depending on data range
- **Polygon rendering**: Real-time updates
- **Memory usage**: Optimized with data caching

## 🎨 UI Reference

The application follows the provided UI reference with:
- Orange/amber color scheme for sliders
- Clean, modern interface
- Intuitive polygon management
- Responsive sidebar layout
- Professional color rule configuration

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Export polygon data to CSV/JSON
- Import/export polygon configurations
- Advanced weather data visualization (charts, graphs)
- User authentication and cloud storage
- Real-time weather data integration
- Mobile app version
